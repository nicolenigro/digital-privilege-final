      and Gender
    </h1>
    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>In this project, we will be focusing on Reddit and gender. With sentiment analysis and data visualizations,
      our findings will demonstrate the relationship between subreddit demographic and activity.
    </p>
    <h2>r/ForeverAlone</h2>
    <p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAlone/">r/ForeverAlone</a> is a subreddit for Forever Alone Folks.
      It has 166k members and was created on September 15, 2010. The 9 rules of this subreddit are:
      <ol type="1">
        <li>Be polite, friendly and welcoming.</li>
        <li>Do not tell anyone they are not forever alone enough to be here. Foreveralone has no firm definition.</li>
        <li>No inflammatory comments.</li>
        <li>No incel speak or references.</li>
        <li>No linking to other subreddits or personal blogs.</li>
        <li>No trolling.</li>
        <li>No Creating Drama.</li>
        <li>Do not post your dick.</li>
        <li>No "rate me" threads.</li>
      </ol>
      <br>
      Using <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/kingburrito666/the-demographic-rforeveralone-dataset">The Demographic
      /r/ForeverAlone Dataset</a> available on Kaggle, we created data visualizations to highlight the relationship between 
      gender and friends, mental health, etc. In 2016, a survey was posted to the r/ForeverAlone subreddit, asking questions such
      as "What is your Gender?", "Do you have social anxiety/phobia?", and "Are you depressed?". The survey got 469
      responses from redditors active on the r/ForeverAlone subreddit; this data is our dataset for this section.
      <br>
      <br>
      The question "What kind of help do you want from others?" was a select all type of question. For respondents who identify
      as female (n=73), the most frequent words are help (42); want (41); date (29); set (17); coaching (12). However, looking at
      the frequency of help alone is misleading because it is used within the phrase "I don't want help."

      For respondents who identify as male (n=393), the most frequent words are date (235); help (195); want (193); set (146);
      wingman (115).

      <br>
      <br>
      The question "What have you done to try and improve yourself?" was another select all that apply question. For respondents
      who identify as female, the most frequent words are clubs (62); gym (58); exercise (31); join (31); meet (31).

      For respondents who identify as male, the most frequent words are gym (320); clubs (218); exercise (164); joined (162);
      join (109).

    <h2>Sentiment Analysis</h2>
    <p> The Sentiment Analaysis data collected comes from the <a href="https://github.com/google-research-datasets/coarse-discourse">Google Coarse-Discourse</a> github page.
      Using the raw data, we collected the text and subreddit headings from the joined JSON file and created plain text files with this information.
      Next we used the nltk VADER package to run sentiment analysis on all of the collected subreddit threads in an attempt to determine if overall, reddit
      is a supportive environment.

    This visualization shows data from the 255 subreddit threads which had the most textual data. The data demonstrates that
    reddit contains much higher levels of positive sentiment than negative. This may be surprising given the perception that
    places like reddit, 4chan, and 8chan (popular anonymous forum websites) have become breeding grounds for certain hate groups.
    However, we believe that the evidence here suggests that many more people use reddit as a site to seek support and help.
    Even comparing this data to the subreddit r/ForeverAlone suggests that people are searching for solidarity and support.
    When users come together to voice their complaints and pains, they find solace in the fact that others can hear them and relate
    to them. We previously noted that some reddit posters in r/ForeverAlone would voice the fact that they don't want help,
    but the fact that they are frequenting this subreddit suggests that it may in itself be a form of help. After all, being heard
    is sometimes all a person wants, and an anonymous forum such as reddit provides a perfect environment for that.
