    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>In this project, we will be focusing on Reddit and gender. With sentiment analysis and data visualizations,
      our findings will demonstrate the relationship between subreddit demographic and activity.
    </p>
    <h2>r/ForeverAlone</h2>
    <p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAlone/">r/ForeverAlone</a> is a subreddit for Forever Alone Folks.
      It has 166k members and was created on September 15, 2010. The 9 rules of this subreddit are:
      <ol type="1">
        <li>Be polite, friendly and welcoming.</li>
        <li>Do not tell anyone they are not forever alone enough to be here. Foreveralone has no firm definition.</li>
        <li>No inflammatory comments.</li>
        <li>No incel speak or references.</li>
        <li>No linking to other subreddits or personal blogs.</li>
        <li>No trolling.</li>
        <li>No Creating Drama.</li>
        <li>Do not post your dick.</li>
        <li>No "rate me" threads.</li>
      </ol>

      Using <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/kingburrito666/the-demographic-rforeveralone-dataset">The Demographic
      /r/ForeverAlone Dataset available on Kaggle</a> we created data visualizations to highlight the demographics
      of this particular subreddit. In 2016, a survey was posted to the r/ForeverAlone subreddit, asking questions such
      as "What is your Gender?", "Do you have social anxiety/phobia?", and "Are you depressed?". The survey got 469
      responses from redditors active on the r/ForeverAlone subreddit; this data is our dataset for this section.
